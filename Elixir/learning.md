# Learning Elixir
At first glance, I really like elixir.\
The docs seem decent, and the language seems like something that people would actually
use. Though there seems to be a small community, I think that the docs are good 
enough that you dont need a complex set of forums to make it work.

I enjoy writing in it well enough, but running your program is kind of a pain.
you can use the interactive interpreter `iex` and test things out like you would 
in other script langs like python or js, but you can also compile and run in 
the Erlang runtime. This seems to work pretty well, but I'm a little hesitant to
write very much code with a dependancy like that. Though, to be entirely honest,
I'm not sure how big a deal it is.
